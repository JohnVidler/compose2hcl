# Docker-Compose to Nomad HCL

Yet another attempt to convert from a compose file to a Nomad deployment HCL file, written from scratch mostly for fun.

Uses a recursive descent parser to handle the docker-compose input, and spits out an hcl file in the browser.

## Running

Just clone the repository, and open `index.html` in whatever browser you favour. No compilation.

Requires an internet connection if you want fancy (ish) fonts.
